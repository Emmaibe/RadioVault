              With our technology, streams will ba accounted for any time the
              music is being listened to. This means when someone is listening
              to an NFT, a stream of licensing purposes is happening.

              With our infrastructure, you can be assured that you own and
              control access to your music and its data. This will allow for you
              to know where streams are coming from on the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Include all web 2.0 and web 3.0 music metadata & DSPs for any
              particular song by and artist or record-label owned music. This
              will allow you to distribute and license your music on the
              blockchain and off-chain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest problem the blockchain and music space currently faces
              is how to properly license NFT technology/web 3.0 systems. With
              this infrastructure we solve that problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vaults are totally controlled by the individual or entity that
              owns permissions to license music. This will invite thousands of
              musicians to the blockchain whether thay are an individual artist
              or with a record label!
